Here are some of the basic SQL commands:

Data Definition Language (DDL) Commands:
CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table.
ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table (add, drop, or modify columns).
DROP TABLE: Deletes a table.
    
Data Manipulation Language (DML) Commands:
INSERT INTO: Inserts rows into a table.
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
DELETE FROM: Deletes rows from a table.

Data Query Language (DQL) Commands:
SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables (same as DML).
WHERE: Filters the result set based on specific conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
GROUP BY: Groups rows based on one or more columns.
HAVING: Filters groups created by the GROUP BY clause.
    
Data Control Language (DCL) Commands:
GRANT: Grants privileges to users or roles.
REVOKE: Revokes privileges from users or roles.
Example:

SQL
-- Create a table named 'students'
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Insert data into the 'students' table
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, grade)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 15, '10th'),
       (2, 'Bob', 16, '11th'),
       (3, 'Charlie', 14, '9th');

-- Retrieve all students from the 'students' table
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Retrieve students older than 15
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 15;

-- Sort students by age in descending order
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;
